# Machine Learning and AI Algorithms Repository

A collection of machine learning algorithms from scratch using python
Welcome to the Machine Learning and AI Algorithms Repository! This repository contains a collection of implementations for various machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning algorithms. It is organized into different categories such as clustering, regression, classification, and deep learning.

This repository is meant to serve as both an educational resource and a practical implementation guide. The code is organized by algorithm type, and each algorithm includes an implementation, an example case, and relevant mathematical explanations.

## Introduction
This repository provides the implementation of classic and state-of-the-art algorithms in machine learning, AI, and deep learning. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics of these algorithms or an expert exploring new ideas, this repository will help you understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI algorithms.

The code is structured with clear separation between algorithm implementations, example usage, and in-depth explanations.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following main directories:

+ clustering/: Contains various clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.
+ regression/: Includes algorithms for regression, such as Linear and Logistic Regression.
+ classification/: Focuses on classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
+ deep_learning/: Includes deep learning models like Neural Networks, CNNs, etc.
  
Each algorithm folder contains the following structure:
+ algorithm_name.py: The Python implementation of the algorithm.
+ examples/: Example scripts demonstrating the use of the algorithm.
+ README.md: A description of the algorithm, its mathematical foundations, and usage examples.
  
## Algorithm Categories
